### Hi there 👋

- 🏫  I'm an infrastructure engineer at [Zhipu AI (z.ai)](https://z.ai) , also a graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
- 🌱  Interested in infrastructure and enterprise hardware. I deal with **containers**, **networking**, **Kubernetes**, and **Linux** a lot. Over the years, I have worked on _containeriztion of applications_ (2020), _app delivery using Kubernetes_ (2021-2022), and now I am working on _AI infra_ (2024+). Oh sorry I typed AI and now you must be saying: ahhh this guy is saying AI again! Nope, I am also tired of this AI hype and by saying AI infra I actually mean inference optimizations, networking, scheduling, and etc.
- 💬  Ask me anything. Here's how to reach me: [outlook](mailto:charlie_c_0129@outlook.com)
- 😄  My public repositories are small projects that I worked on over the years. Although I mostly work on internal (private) projects, I will sometimes write blogs to share the lessons I learned.
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I use Unix-Like operating systems, i.e., macOS and Linux, and I hate Windows (except for gaming).
  - I am allergic to disorganized systems. No ligering configuration files are allowed on my system.
  - I love observability, even on my personal computer. I am monitoring my systems all the time and finding incidents.
  - I dig deep into the performance of applications. Profile before optimization.

### What I was working on?

- 2019: Undergraduate life begins. Doing curricular work: small projects in C++, Java.
- 2020: Start to realize the power of containers. I was packaging services on my server using Docker.
- 2021-2022: Doing opensource projects related to Kubernetes (KubeVela) and became the Approver of KubeVela community. Deeper into cloud-native infrastructure.
- 2023: Graduate life begins (which is miserable, I cannot go into detail currently). Doing nothing. Wasting life.
- 2024: Someone saved me. (Details will be provided in the future). Working on AI infra, including networking, scheduling, and inference optimizations. Managing clusters of over 10k GPUs.
