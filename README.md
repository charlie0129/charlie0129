### Hi there 👋

- 🏫  I'm a graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
- 🌱  Interested in infrastructure and enterprise hardware. I deal with containers, networking, Kubernetes, and Linux a lot. Over the years, I have worked on containeriztion of applications (2020), app delivery using Kubernetes (2021-2022), and now I am working on AI infra (2024+). I have heard you saying: ahhh this guy said AI again! Nope, I am also tired of the AI hype and by saying AI infra I actually mean high performance networking (e.g. RDMA), scheduling and, inference optimizations.
- 📫  Ask me anything. Here's how to reach me: [outlook](mailto:charlie_c_0129@outlook.com)
- ⚡  My public repositories are small projects that I worked on over the years. Although I mostly work on internal (private) projects, I will sometimes write blogs to share the lessons I learned.
