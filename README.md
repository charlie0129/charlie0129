### Hi there 👋

- 🏫  I'm a first-year graduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
- 🌱  Interested in infrastructure and enterprise hardware. I deal with **containers**, **networking**, **Kubernetes**, and **Linux** a lot. Over the years, I have worked on _containeriztion of applications_ (2020), _app delivery using Kubernetes_ (2021-2022), and now I am working on _AI infra_ (2024+). Oh sorry I typed AI and now you must be saying: ahhh this guy is saying AI again! Nope, I am also tired of this AI hype and by saying AI infra I actually mean networking, scheduling, and etc.
- 💬  Ask me anything. Here's how to reach me: [outlook](mailto:charlie_c_0129@outlook.com)
- 😄  My public repositories are small projects that I worked on over the years. Although I mostly work on internal (private) projects, I will sometimes write blogs to share the lessons I learned.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use macOS and Linux. I hate Windows (except some special cases). I'm allergic to disorganized systems. No ligering configuration files are allowed on my system.
